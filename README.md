# VowelCounter

A C++ program that displays the number of times a letter appears in a file, and the total number of vowels.

The user enters the executable name and a file name in the command line (or an error message is shown and the program is exited). If the 
file is opened correctly, a while loop runs as long as characters are being read from the file. If the character is read, a counter variable 
increments by one.

The program displays the number of times each letter appears in the file, as well as the total number of vowels that were read.
